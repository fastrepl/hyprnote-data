- `<VERSION>/AGENTS.md` should be generated based on `fastrepl/hyprnote`'s git tag.
  - For example, `v1.0.1/*` should be based on `https://github.com/fastrepl/hyprnote/tree/desktop_v1.0.1`.
  - Each `AGENTS.md` should contain clear descriptions/examples of how data on user devices looks.
  - Each `AGENTS.md` should never reference `main` or migrations. 
  - Describe how data looks in detail. Never make mistakes on format or filename.
- `<VERSION>/<NAME>` should be a folder that can be used for the `CONTENT_BASE` env variable.
  - For example, `CONTENT_BASE="$REPO/v1.0.1/simple" /Applications/Hyprnote\ Staging.app/Contents/MacOS/hyprnote-staging`
  - This ensures new versions work properly with existing user data.
